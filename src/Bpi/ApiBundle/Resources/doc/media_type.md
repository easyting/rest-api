BPI Custom Media Type Overview
==============================

BPI Custom Media Type is expressed in XML syntax. Valid document should have the root node:

`<bpi version=""></bpi>`

Root node may have one or many **entities**. If there are many first level entities they must be of the same name.

Entities
--------

Entity is predefined set of **links**, **properties** and **sub entities**.

`<entity name=""></entity>`

Links
-----

BPI Media Type may have one or more links following to other resources. These are meant to provide explicit URLs so that proper API clients donâ€™t need to construct URLs on their own. It is highly recommended that API clients use these. Doing so will make future upgrades of the API easier for developers.

`<links><link rel="relation_name" href="URI"></links>`

Properties
----------

Propery is a holder of primitive data with some meta information.

`<properties><property name="" type="" title="">value</property></properties>`


Sub entities
------------

Sub entity is the same as first class entity except that it always related with the parent entity and can't exists separately.
